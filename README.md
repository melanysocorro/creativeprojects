### ðŸ’œ Edible Arrangements: Text-Generated Poems on the Queer Experience
#### Summary 
For this project, I chose to focus on creating a short poetry novel based upon queer experiences. Specifically, in terms of relationships and in light of the five stages of grief. I organized the poems under the five stages of grief as an analogy for failed relationships and the cyclical nature of heartbreak. I staged the novel to reflect an art book by incorporating AI generated images from MidJourney and Stable Diffusion Online Playground. The samples were derived from both, my personal creative writing, and several books on Project Gutenberg authored by women. The methodology used to generate this output was GPT-2 via Google Colab and Tracery. 

<strong> Text-Generation Methods</strong>
1. Collect sources from Project Gutenberg.
2. Filter through content, pull desired content (quotes, scenes, etc). 
3. Incorporate final filtered content into text file. 
4. Run text file through GPT-2 via Google Collab.
5. Extract output. 
6. Use output for Tracery code. 
7. Extract Tracery output. 
8. Incorporate final content into new text file.
9. Run text file through GPT-2 via Google Collab.
10. Extract final output. 

<i>*Part of final output was derived from the first GPT-2 and Tracery generation.</i>

  - Wuthering Heights by Emily BrontÃ«

<strong>Artist Statement</strong>

Experiences are monumental. Being able to permeate the barrier between reading about an experience and being cocooned in the emotional whirlpool of an experience is often my goal with the creative work that I do. I often reflect on Sandra Hardings, Feminist Standpoint Theory when I begin a creative process. One of the three principles of Feminist Standpoint Theory is that communities that are marginalized often hold the most significant knowledge and ability to ask questions that non-marginalized communities may not be cognizant of due to their privileges in society.

I feel this theory applies immaculately to the experience of being queer in society. We experience the stages of grief in many contexts, at nearly every stage of life. With this short novel, I intended to bring a bit more light to the experience of being in a queer relationship while simultaneously playing on the relationship we develop with ourselves throughout our lives. I used AI generation for imagery and multiple cycles of text generation for a curated output that will align with the objectives of this project. As a final easter egg, I curated this novel to mimic an art book one may see in a museum gift shop, because often we seem to be regarded as nothing more than something for people to gawk at or use for politically-correct decoration.

### ðŸ’œ The Cyber Sex: The Influence of AI on Autonomy
#### Artist Statement 
The Cyber Sex serves as a product of creativity instigated from the unlikeliest of places, Twitter. AI has developed rapidly within the past several years, itâ€™s public accessibility reaching new heights and new unsettling consequences. Four rows of teeth and twelve fingers proved to be immensely disturbing, but the inconceivable revulsion that consumed my psyche upon unearthing the reality of deepfake porn was inexplicably all-consuming in its devastation. While Deepfake AI has been wandering the infernal terrain of the internet for some time now, it has become no less capable of being utilized for malicious purposes. This new appendage of sheer malice is one the driving factors behind this project. The Cyber Sex is an abstract representation of the extinction of authentic autonomy as a result of the growing AI market. It is set to display an environment similar to that of an early 19th century public gallery while incorporating elements of modern technology. Each segment was prompted to incorporate the artistic styles of this era including Impressionism and oil on canvas. 
        
Historical reference was incorporated into The Cyber Sex as a form of parallelism. One that emphasizes the prevalent longevity of the issue of autonomy within communities of women. The foundation of this issue predates modern society and profoundly integrates itself into new tools as a form of perpetuating its existence. The Cyber Sex serves as a play on the repetition of history and the magnification of historic issues under the guise of novelty. 

The Cyber Sex was curated with a variety of diverse tools: Stable Diffusion 2.1 Demo, Deforum Stable Diffusion via Google Collab, Motionleap, Adobe Photoshop, Canva, Devianart, ChatGPT, and EpicSound. The static imagery was carefully prompt engineered and executed via Stable Diffusion 2.1 Demo and DreamStudio. Subsequently, select images were transformed into animations with the assistance of Motionleap. The videos utilized were crafted by Deforum Stable Diffusion via Google Colab, all of which were titled graciously by ChatGPT. One objective of the work was to create meaningful motion based on â€œPicture This: How Pictures Work '' a novel by Molly Bang. Molly Bang describes the significance of shapes in stimulating underlying emotional responses, I utilized their philosophies by applying the same concepts to motion as opposed to shapes. Adobe Photoshop, Canva, Devianart, and Epicsound served to assist with the cohesion of the environment. These tools assisting in the incorporation of audio, detailing, and photo editing.
