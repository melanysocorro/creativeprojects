;
For us, as the gale is sipping;
And then the storm
Crackling across the sea;
We stood at last in view,
And shone a radiant golden Blake
Crackling across the sun.

And then the storm
Kept beating in the sand;
And then the mist
Kept breaking over us.

And then the man
Came flying towards us,
And startedle and scream and wring
The dying Airmon, and his two breast
Kept leaning against the mantel;
Another time, another creak,
And creak wept on the mantel.

Another time, another creak;
Another creak, another creak.
