Until I die.


Three weeks passed since I had seen her,
  From the deepest melancholy to the grave
  I felt the sting of desperation

The dying need scarce register

When a kinsman is murdered.



Three weeks passed since I had seen her,
  From the deepest melancholy to the grave

And the dying need hardly register

When a kinsman is murdered.



I felt the sting of desperation
The dying need hardly register

When a kinsman is murdered.


The next morning, as I stood at our feet,
A kinsman seemed to come to me,
A voice of common clamor,
And a voice of lamentation,
And a tune to sing.

In the far distance,
A village folk heard them,
And a sea to sea race,
  And miles to go.

In silence, they talked
A box of Arabian steeds,
  And miles to go.



I felt the sting of desperation
The dying need hardly register

When a kinsman was murdered.

Hope was the thing that kept
It sooth;
Hope was the thing that kept
It sooth; Joy was the thing that kept
It sooth; Care was the thing that made
It sooth; and So much the thing that was
Done with, it was time to go.

The next morning, as I stood at
Our feet,
A strange voice said,
"Bold youth, selfish poor;
We are, sir; not unlike you,
Weasels, and Grimm, and any other
species of animal who are timid, vain,
deaf, or indifferent. We are the idle, the dimly lit
people, according to custom, to be
furnished in the dim rooms of our
furniture. Your memory is our treasure,
and your will is our thank;
We have neither, sir; you have made us what we are;
let us be your treasure, and keep it, forever. . .

You know well that love is the fruit of hard work,
and work always pays dividends. It is thoughtless to condemn
you, or laugh at you, or label you,
or label us, if you think that effort, money, or privilege is
the only reward for being good. It is thoughtless to condemn
you, or laugh at you, or label you,
if you think that reason is the soul's judge.

In spite of our most recent troubles,
you show no signs of abating at last.

The heart asks pleasure first,
And then, excuse from pain;
And then, those little anodynes that keep
the mind going, first.

Let us be elegant or die!
Let us be poor, or get a knoll!
That would be selfish!

For pleasure, I think, the heart desires.

For affection, the heart desires it.

For self-improvement, the heart desires it.

For truth the heart teaches.

For justice the heart teaches.



I felt a funeral in my brain,
  And mourners, to and fro,
Kept treading, treading, till it seemed
  That sense was breaking through.

And when they all were seated,
  A service like a drum
Kept beating, beating, till I thought
  My mind was going numb.

And then I heard them lift a box,
  And creak across my soul
With those same boots of lead, again.
  Then space began to toll

As all the heavens were a bell,
  And Being but an ear,
And I and silence some strange race,
  Wrecked, solitary, here.


I meant to find her when I came;
  Death had the same design;
But the success was his, it seems,
  And the discomfit mine.

I meant to tell her how I longed
  For just this single time;
But Death had told her so the first,
  And she had hearkened him.

To wander now is my abode;
  To rest, -- to rest would be
