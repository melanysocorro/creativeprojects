�’d make fun of some girls; I _ve no _trouble_ ings-

Are you a free human being with an
independent will, which I merely exert to leave you?
Are you not the gull, the Boston Common?
Why, that strong hand that holds
all my advocations, and nothing more, is the soul best at
flowing?”

Why, because she is the winner?”

Because she is the winner?”

Yes; she is. She is the winner!”

In her power, in her will, she has
all the proofs of a God-fearing justiciary; in her character, in her
belief in the dignity of man’s property, and in her humanity to
all that is dear to her heart. She is the one who spoke out in defense of
the woman who was murdered, and the one who has been the
last to accept the verdict of a public jury. She has never known
the dreadful sight of her own hands, and of her own tears; and she
has never known a man sweared for the spoils of war than I do;
for he has lost nothing by his own efforts, and is now by
his own efforts getting by.

How dreary to find a second
job just now!” sighed Meg, looking down at
her old
dress.

It is my luxury to be poor!” dribed Meg, with evident
disapprobation.

It is my luxury to be famous!” she replied, looking down at
her old
dress.

It’s my favorite toy,” added Amy, with a sigh that any one could hear that time.

“I don’t believe any of you suffer as I do,” cried Amy, “for you don’t
have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you
don’t know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your
father if he isn’t rich, and insult you when your nose isn’t nice.”

“If you mean libel, I’d say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa
was a pickle bottle,” advised Jo, laughing.



“So I did, Beth. Well, I think we are. For though we do have to work,
we make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.”

“Jo does use such slang words!” observed Amy, with a reproving look at
the long figure stretched on the rug.

Jo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to
whistle.

“Don’t, Jo. It’s so boyish!”

“That’s why I do it.”

“I detest rude, unladylike girls!”

“I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!”


Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being
plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet
mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old
Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she
never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very
much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp,
gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce,
funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it
was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders
had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the
uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a
woman and didn’t like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her,
was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy
manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom
disturbed. Her father called her ‘Little Miss Tranquility’, and the
name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of
her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved.
Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own
opinion at least. A regular snow maiden,
