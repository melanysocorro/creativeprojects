1. eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest
blush.
 
by you, i was properly humbled.
 
the humblest tasks get beautified if loving hands do them.
 
conceit spoils the finest genius,
 
**********
28. insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.
 
i meant to tell her how i longed.
the heart asks pleasure first,
deaden suffering.
 
**************
2. pink, small, and punctual,
aromatic, low,
a privilege of hurricane
to memory and me.
 
*******************
 
3. offending and insulting me, 
you chose to tell me that you liked me
against your will, 
against your reason, 
against your character?
 
i admire and love
you.
 
************************
 
4. you may kiss me, and cry
may you not rest as long as i am living;
you said i killed you—haunt me, then
 
only do not leave me in
this abyss, where i cannot find you!
i cannot live without my life! i cannot live without my soul!
 
*************************
5. another time, another creak;
another creak, another creak.
 
 two breast
leaning against the mantel;
 
another time, another creak,
and creak wept on the mantel.
 
another creak, another creak.
 
another creak, some day.
 
a hurricane is expected.
 
borne, and forgotten.
 
***********************
 
6. i sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to girls
 
i don’t believe any of you suffer as i do
 
for you are neither fit nor smart, and
inevitably gay, hetero, or any other sex.
 
***************************
7. had she not known that i had been the
favourable name,
the last name she had seen thrown into the sea. 
it was the name she had been expecting to hear from.
 
************************************************
8. i felt a hand on my back, and a sound familiarity
had established in me. 
 
the familiarity was as instantly
felt as the first time. 
 
the familiarity seemed to stretch
over all my body, to the ribs, to the mouth, to the lips
**********************************
9. why did you betray your own heart, jo? i have not one
word of comfort. you deserve this. you have killed yourself. 
 
yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears they’ll blight
you—they’ll damn you.
 
**************************************
10. i am the bird, and the wind everything.
 
you are the buoyant bird, and the ballast water everything is.
 
i am the mooring gull, and the mooring water everything is.
 
you are the rainbow, and the sea and sky and everything is.
 
i am the misty morning mist, and the stars and the mother earth nothing but me.
 
the bush, the garden, and the little pond all round me.
 
the dresser, the stereo, the tv, the radio, the fridge, the cup, the box, the box of presents—it is all in me.
 
the computer, the novel, and the box of presents all the rest is in me.
 
 
*********************************
11. mind, and laugh at her jokes, even though they
mean wrong; they even hurt, in some cases, even kill, a
romantic thought which you have just experienced, and have roared a
newly. 
 
in such cases as this, it is, i think, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. 
 
it is natural that obligation should be
felt, and if i could feel gratitude, i would now thank you. 
 
but i cannot--i have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly. 
 
***********************************
12. and if it were any comfort, it would be
against her own will, she was to be conceited
about me, she would be sure
of it.
 
and if it were any comfort, it would be
against her own will, she was to be fatal
of & me.
 
and if it were any comfort, it would be
against her own will, she was to be impetuous
of me, she was to be full
of & me.
 
and if it were any comfort, it would be
against her own will, she was to be
cruelty-free.
 
*********************************
13. the dying need but is well-deserved,
the honourable have been few;
the rich had it better,
the poor had it better;
the humblest tasks were best
done when the hands were between the lips.
 
**************************************
 
14. bold and proper, some nights i should rather be dead than
in this happy world than in this unhappy one.
 
i felt a funeral in my brain, and a most queer familiarity with
the tomboy whom i had just met stood by, 
face to face.
*******************************************
15. caught between his two
gut feelings he rose, and fell to one
to hug his bosoms, and to kiss his lips,
while thoughts wandered his immovable being
was always visible in his dream.
 
******************************************
16. the soul searches for its
true self in a silence which cannot be
found in words long lost.
***********************************
17. and i for one's own
futile self 
i raise one's voice against
the arbitrary power of
 
vices, androgyny, and concealing
my own, as much as your own soul.
 
*************************************
18. to suffer, to wander, to live in the
burnt earth, to have my say ignored,
to be suborned, loathed, pampered, and sometimes even murdered,
for the same reason as i do: because it leads me to believe
that any good can come of developing into a species of
futile servility, which, if allowed to proceed, will make
me a species of equal sex.
***********************************
19. you are the oldest i have ever known, and i hope will be
the last. what the hell are you going to think of me?
are you the gull, fool, or the pedlar, as we are called here
in ireland? are you the vain,–or even the most foolish of us.
*******************************************
20. three weeks passed since i had seen her,
  from the deepest melancholy to the grave
  i felt the sting of desperation.
********************************************
21. let us be elegant or die!
let us be poor, or get a knoll!
that would be selfish!
 
for pleasure, i think, the heart desires.
 
for affection, the heart desires it.
 
for self-improvement, the heart desires it.
 
for truth the heart teaches.
 
for justice the heart teaches.
***************************************
22. you know well that love is the fruit of hard work,
and work always pays dividends. it is thoughtless to condemn
you, or laugh at you, or label you,
or label us, if you think that effort, money, or privilege is
the only reward for being good. it is thoughtless to condemn
you, or laugh at you, or label you,
if you think that reason is the soul's judge.
*************************************
23. women are supposed to be very calm generally: but they are full too late,
and misery follows
much the more slowly.”
the humblest tasks get beautified if loving hands do
all that loving talking.”

futile conception,
 
socially stimulating orgasm,
 
futile affection,


i sometimes have a queer feeling with respect to bras and pants,
and loincloths, and knucksoms,
and cupids, and pockets,
 
for lack of a better name,
 
a feminine name, indeed,
 
a most queer of a name.
**************************************************




you are the oldest I have ever known, and I hope will be
the last,
you are the most curious animal you have ever been,
you were the last to see us, and I hope will be
the last,
you were the last to kiss us,
and wept over us,
and murdered us,




****************************************




If you would permit me,
to salute you,
face to face;
couple us, take my cup, and kiss the bottom.
If you would desire to receive me,
take my hand, and count my blessings,
of the kingdom of heaven and hell,
you shall find me, in a little time.




******************************************************


you liked me wrong; you liked me well-groomed;
you liked me well-pinked;
you liked me full of yourself;
well done, girls; now get over yourself;
fuck, you deserve this; you have killed yourself.
 
yes, you may kiss me, and cry; and wring out my kisses and tears they’ll blight
you—they’ll damn you.

the words of a dead creature on the morrow

futile being.

yes, dear, there is blood

in the barns
of thoughtless adventure

this is a small sample

their own misery

order yourself and your dog a cup of tea
